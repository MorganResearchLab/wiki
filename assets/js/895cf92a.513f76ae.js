This is where Slurm interactive session comes into play. With Slurm interactive session we can run our programs within HPC clusters in real-time. So instead of using login node with the limited resource that it has, we can utilise the nodes in a full shell session.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"working-with-hpc/using-maxwell":{"id":"working-with-hpc/using-maxwell","title":"Using Maxwell","description":"There are several ways on how you can connect to Maxwell","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
