This is where Slurm interactive session comes into play. With Slurm interactive session we can run our programs within HPC clusters in real-time. So instead of using login node with the limited resource that it has, we can utilise the nodes in a full shell session.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"working-with-hpc/using-maxwell":{"id":"working-with-hpc/using-maxwell","title":"Using Maxwell","description":"There are several ways on how you can connect to Maxwell","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"working-with-hpc/working-with-r":{"id":"working-with-hpc/working-with-r","title":"Working with R interactively","description":"From time to time you may be required to work with R script as most of the bioinformatics/computational biology packages are written in R (need citation).

But what if you want to run a script that requires high memory and your computer doesn\'t have enough RAM? Yes you can always rely on Maxwell! It\'s pretty straightforward to work with R on HPC as you can just create a ready-to-run R script and run it using the Rscript command.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
