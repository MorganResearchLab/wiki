# Introduction

Welcome to the **Morgan Lab Wiki**! 

This space is dedicated to sharing and documenting the knowledge and resources within the Morgan Lab at the University of Aberdeen. The goal is to ensure that all information is well-documented for reproducibility and easy access. Here, you will find a collection of resources available in the Morgan Lab shared folder or just knowledge sharing in general.

Every knowledge is valuable and we encourage you to post anything that you find useful for the lab member to this Wiki. You can refer to the [Contributing](contributing) page as a guide to start adding the knowledge and documentation, it's easy and you can start with zero experience of Web Dev. New ideas and feedbacks are always welcome, you can contact the maintainers.
