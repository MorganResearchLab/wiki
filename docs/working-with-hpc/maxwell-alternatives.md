So Maxwell is down for a while now and you want to still work on your analyses, here are some alternatives (free compute power) that you can use:
## [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
**Pros**:
- Free access to GPUs (T4, P100) and TPUs
- Jupyter notebook interface
- You can connect to your Google Drive easily without additional libraries
- Supports Python, R and Julia
- Allows custom datasets, and pip/apt installs
- Pro/Pro+ options offer longer sessions, more resources
- Supports Gemini AI

**Cons**:
- Session timeout after 12 hrs (free), idle timeout ~90 mins, there's a hack for this but I will try to explain it on another post
- Unstable availability of high-tier GPU
- Your data will be gone once the session ends (So make sure to connect to your Google Drive)

**Verdict**:
- I love Google Colab for quick prototyping and testing my code for analysis, Gemini AI can be helpful sometimes too, the only thing that I hate about it is the timeout thing prevents you from running long process


## [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
**Pros**:
- Free GPU (T4) and 16GB RAM, up to 30 hrs/week
- Preloaded with many ML/DL libraries
- Versioning (You can run your job and leave it be without the worry of having timeout like Google Colab)
- Supports Python and R

**Cons**:
- GPU sessions limited to 9 hrs max
- Fewer customizations than Colab
- Require additional libraries to connect to external storage

**Verdict**:
- I usually go with Kaggle Notebook despite I like Google Colab UI better but Kaggle Notebook has everything you need most of the time

## [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)
**Pros**:
- Designed specifically for R
- Native RStudio interface â€” no setup needed
- Great for RMarkdown, Shiny, Quarto, and teaching
- Supports CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub packages
- Persistent storage and auto-saving

**Cons**:
- No GPU/TPU access
- Limited compute (1 GB RAM on free tier)
- Session timeout after 1 hour (free)
- 15 project-hours/month limit on free tier
- Very slow for heavy data processing and sometimes it fails

**Verdict**:
- Only good for testing R packages on a small-sized dataset because of the fast installation of the packages, otherwise I barely use it
